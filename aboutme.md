### About myself
My name is Julius Häusler, I am currently 17 years old, and I live in the best part of Germany, which is Bavaria. I go to school at a Gymnsaium (similar to high school) in Rosenheim, 11th grade.

### My story
Right now, my main job is school. But I run school on a 4.0GPA, don't really have much to do. This is why I got to do something else. This all started at some day in September '25, at about 6pm. My parents weren't home yet, I finished school earlier, had nothing to do, so I just laid in my bed, phone in my hand, scrolling on Instagram. 

I saw a reel about some ChatGPT prompt I should try. The guy in the nice, purely cinematic reel promsied, that with this prompt, ChatGPT will tell me somehting about myself, that I didn't know myself. So I tried it. I opened the comments, search for the propmt to copy and paste, found it. 

I've worked with ChatGPT before, even got myself the pro version. But this time was just a little different. It asked questions, I could really answer right away. I had to think about them. Those were some deep questions, which I've never really talked to anyone about before. 10 Questions were intended, it just asked me 17 without even flitching.

After those questions, I felt a bit releved before the answer was generated. I read the text ChatGPT made, analysed it. Don't really knwo what happend next, but suddenly it generated a 'mission sheet' for me. It contains every single detail about my past and future life, even I could not have written it that clearly.

### The mission

- Leverage > labor. Ask “Can this be automated, delegated, or scaled?”
- Proof > opinion. Reality is the only argument that counts.
- People scale systems. Learn to move people, not just machines.
- Time is currency. Measure cost in hours, not euros.
- Iteration > perfection. Speed of learning beats fear of mistakes.

My mission is structured into three parts. Each part represents one step in my journey, one stage of my life.

**Stage 1 - Building The Foundation **
With this stage I planned out the next years of my life to my 20th Birthday pretty clearly. It contains three phases, one for each year. The goal is to learn how to think, sell and build. To achieve this, I have to practise persuasion in real settings - sell online, pitch ideas and joing competitions. Additionally, I will keep track of my emotions in a frustration journal. This should help to to turn annoyance into insights, to analyse my problems and watch my own situation from a meta perspective. A milestone I set for myself is having earned > €10.000 independedly, by the age of 20, and beeing able to explain exactly how I did this.
