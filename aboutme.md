### About myself
My name is Julius HÃ¤usler, I am currently 17 years old, and I live in the best part of Germany, which is Bavaria. I go to school at a Gymnsaium (similar to high school) in Rosenheim, 11th grade.

### My story
Right now, my main job is school. But I run school on a 4.0GPA, don't really have much to do. This is why I got to do something else. This all started at some day in September '25, at about 6pm. My parents weren't home yet, I finished school earlier, had nothing to do, so I just laid in my bed, phone in my hand, scrolling on Instagram. 

I saw a reel about some ChatGPT prompt I should try. The guy in the nice, purely cinematic reel promsied, that with this prompt, ChatGPT will tell me somehting about myself, that I didn't know myself. So I tried it. I opened the comments, search for the propmt to copy and paste, found it. 

I've worked with ChatGPT before, even got myself the pro version. But this time was just a little different. It asked questions, I could really answer right away. I had to think about them. Those were some deep questions, which I've never really talked to anyone about before. 10 Questions were intended, it just asked me 17 without even flitching.

After those questions, I felt a bit realived, before the answer was generated. I read the text ChatGPT generated, analysed it. Don't really knwo what happend next, but suddenly it generated a 'mission sheet' for me. It contains every single detail about my past and future life, even I could not have written it that clearly.
