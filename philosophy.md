### My Core Philosophy
"Earn freedom by building system that work without me."  

I value competence over comfort, logic over emotion, creation over consumption.
My north star is autonomy - financial, intellectual, and psychological.  


### How I Search To Apply It
- Build systems that replace  repetition with design
- Measure progress in independence, not approval
- Teach others what I learn to scale clarity and patience


### The mission

- Leverage > labor. Ask “Can this be automated, delegated, or scaled?”
- Proof > opinion. Reality is the only argument that counts.
- People scale systems. Learn to move people, not just machines.
- Time is currency. Measure cost in hours, not euros.
- Iteration > perfection. Speed of learning beats fear of mistakes.

My mission is structured into three parts. Each part represents one step in my journey, one stage of my life.

**Stage 1 - Building The Foundation**
With this stage I planned out the next years of my life to my 20th Birthday pretty clearly. It contains three phases, one for each year. The goal is to learn how to think, sell and build. To achieve this, I have to practise persuasion in real settings - sell online, pitch ideas and joing competitions. Additionally, I will keep track of my emotions in a frustration journal. This should help to to turn annoyance into insights, to analyse my problems and watch my own situation from a meta perspective. A milestone I set for myself is having earned > €10.000 independedly, by the age of 20, and beeing able to explain exactly how I did.
