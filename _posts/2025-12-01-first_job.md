This shit get scary really quickly. Had my first day of work today at a local backery. Had to be there at 7:00 in the morning, but decided to make an excellent impression by showing up 15mins early, which worked out great.
My shift there ended at 16:00, so I had to really work from 7am to 10am, then had a break for an hour, and continued working from 11am until 4pm. This was one of the longest and most tiring days Ive ever had.
There where phases during that day where 30 people came in at once, and then there were hours where if I was lucky one or two people found their way in. It was a mix of stress and pure boredom.

Now, after even my first day working, in which I made 112€, which is pretty amazing, I realised following two things:
1) School isn't that bad. I actually really like school when there are no exams at the moment.
2) People do this every fucking day and still are not successful in any way. Hard work isn't the only thing that gets you there.
3) I don't want to do this. I will only do this if I dont really have to, like right now, to have more money as a teenager. But I would rather die than do that type of work if I needed to.

This is how much I hate this thought of living a normal live.
