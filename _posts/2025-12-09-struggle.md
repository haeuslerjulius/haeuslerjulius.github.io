title: "Back Into The Struggle"
---

I am struggeling with efficiency again.
Meaning I consume to much, and build to less, which has a couple of resons. 

I have all my exams for school around this week. I know, that I should work for school and learn, but I also wanna progress in my business/journey. 
Every time I now think about what I could do next in business, I realise that I dont have time for that right now, because I should be learning for school right now.
Problem with that is that this is true, however, after I thought that, I also dont want to do schoolwork. Its quite complicated. 
This results in me beeing distracted by youtube or some other stuff, which leads to neither work for school or work for my business beeing done, which also is quite frustrating at the end of the day.

I have to find a way to quickly get over my school work in these stressful times, so that that is done, and I can get my mind back to the journey.
How exactly Ill do that, I dont know, but I will write about it here and keep you updated.
