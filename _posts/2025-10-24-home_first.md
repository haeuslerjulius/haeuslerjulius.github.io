**First post** So happy to finally have my own page! Looking forward to sharing my journey!

**GitHub learning phase** This is all new to me. I normally work in fully polished environments with beautiful UIs and helpful AI assistants. Now I just have GitHub on one tab of my browser, and ChatGPT for a little help in another tab.  

Feels like exploring.
