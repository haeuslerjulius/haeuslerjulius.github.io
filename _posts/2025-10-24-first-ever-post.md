**First post** So happy to finally have my own page. Looking forward to sharing my journey!
**Github learning phase** This is all new for me. I normally work in fully perfected enviroments with beatiful UIs and helpful AI assistants. Now I just have github on one tab of my browser, and ChatGPT for a little help on tab 2. This is exploring.
