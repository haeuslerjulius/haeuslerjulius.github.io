title: "I Got a 3D Printer for My 17th Birthday"
---

Getting a 3D printer for my 17th birthday wasn’t just a gift — it felt like unlocking a new skill tree. I went with the **Bambu Lab A1 Mini** (not sponsored), mostly because it’s compact, fast, and beginner-friendly without looking like a toy. The moment I unboxed it, I realised how much potential this thing has for the next years of my “Builder” roadmap.  ￼

Right now I’m still in the simplest mode possible: printing objects directly from a smartphone app. It works, but it’s basically “download → print → hope it doesn’t fail.” Zero editing, zero designing, zero learning beyond the basics. It’s fun, but it’s also limiting — and I don’t want to stay stuck in “consumer mode” for long. The whole idea behind my mission is to graduate from using tools to building with them.  ￼

The next step is clear: I need to choose my first real 3D design workflow. Blender, Fusion 360, Shapr3D, Onshape — I haven’t decided yet. 

Once I decide, the plan is to start designing my own parts. Storage solutions, adapters, small functional items — the same way Phase 1 pushed me to build my first digital systems, this printer will push me to build my first physical ones.  ￼

This is a good reminder of what I wrote in my Mission Sheet: “Creation over consumption. Proof over opinion. Iteration over perfection.”  ￼
3D printing is exactly that. You design something, it either works or breaks, and you learn by trying again.

The excitement is real — not because the machine is cool (well, it is kind of cool to see something just commig out of the ground in a perfect form), but because of what it enables. A new tool, a new skill set, and a new area where I can build systems from scratch. Exactly how I want to spend my 17th year.
