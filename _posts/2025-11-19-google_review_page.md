I built a small system that solves a surprisingly big problem: getting customers to actually leave Google Reviews without chasing them manually.

Most businesses know they should collect reviews, but the real world gets messy. People forget. They get busy. Or they promise “I’ll do it later” and never do. At the same time, businesses waste hours following up, sending links, checking if someone already left a review, and trying to keep the whole process consistent.

So I built a simple, clean, automated Google Review page.

What Problem It Solves
	1.	No more sending the Google Maps link over and over.
The page gives customers exactly one place to go.
	2.	Eliminates friction.
Most people don’t leave reviews because they don’t know where to click. My page reduces the process to a single tap.
	3.	Clear split between “positive feedback” and “private feedback.”
Customers who loved the experience can jump straight to Google.
Customers with complaints can send internal feedback instead — which protects the public review score.
	4.	Removes the guesswork.
Businesses no longer have to wonder:
“Did they leave a review? Did they try and fail? Should I follow up again?”
The funnel gives clarity.

What the Page Does in Real Life

It acts as a review gateway. Instead of sending customers to Google directly, they land on my page first. Here’s what happens:
	1.	The customer rates their experience (for example 1–5).
	2.	If they choose 4 or 5 stars, the page redirects them smoothly to the official Google Review window.
	3.	If they choose 1–3 stars, they get a simple feedback form where they can write what went wrong.
	4.	All internal feedback goes into a connected Google Sheet for the business to review later.

This setup protects the business, filters frustration, and boosts the number of real positive reviews.

What the Customer Does

From the customer’s perspective, it’s extremely simple:
	1.	They scan a QR code or tap a link.
	2.	They pick their rating.
	3.	If positive → they’re guided directly to Google Reviews (no searching, no asking “where do I click?”).
	4.	If negative → they can explain what happened privately.

That’s it.

The whole thing takes less than 15 seconds, and people actually complete it because there’s no thinking involved — the page guides them.
