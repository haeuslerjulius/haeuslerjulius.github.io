**Problem:** <br>
I just did not prep for the next day of school, would take to long, had no reminder. <br><br>

**Data**
- Timetable in Google sheets
- Class notes from Google docs

**Worklow** <br>
1) Empty file in google drive <br>
2) Check Timetable -> which classes tomorrow -> subject list <br>
3) For each subject, pull previous lesson's notes <br>
4) send notes to ChatGPT -> summarize in max. 5 bullet points <br>
5) add one paragraph for each subject to google doc <br>
6) send out a push notification to my iPhone <br><br>

**Output**
- updates a google doc
- sends me a notification to my phone

**Conclusion**<br>
I do now remember to quickly have a look at upcomming classes, this process takes >10min.
