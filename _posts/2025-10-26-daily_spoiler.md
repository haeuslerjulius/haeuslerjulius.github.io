**Problem**
I just did not prep for the next day of school, would take to long, had no reminder

**Data**
- Timetable in Google sheets
- Class notes from Google docs

**Worklow**
1) Empty file in google drive
2) Check Timetable -> which classes tomorrow -> subject list
3) For each subject, pull previous lesson's notes
4) send notes to ChatGPT -> summarize in max. 5 bullet points
5) add one paragraph for each subject to google doc
6) send out a push notification to my iPhone

**Output**
- updates a google doc
- sends me a notification to my phone

**Conclusion**
I do now remember to quickly have a look at upcomming classes, and this process takes >10min.
