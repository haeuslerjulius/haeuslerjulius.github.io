Had so much to do with school last seven days, had about two exams a day, which was pretty stressful. Found some time in my stacked calendar to finish coding and writing this prompt. Hope I have more time during the holdidays next week.

### From the roots
I structured this website into two main pages, which are this one, called 'home' and the builds page. This is where I will upload post like this one to tell my story. 
Then there are two other pages, which are 'About me' and 'Philosophy'. Those sites serve the purpose to inform about a topic which doesn't change as much, thats why those are more like a fire-and-forget for me, even thought I'll update them sporadically.

### Behind the scenes
To fill the two main pages with content, I choose to have a folder, in which I simply upload all my posts into. I lable them with 'home' or 'builds' tags to keep them sortet and automate publishing the posts on the right page.
I generally had no idea how this sorting algorithm could work, so I asked ChatGPT. It generated the perfect code literally after the first prompt, I was quite supprised how well that works.
It just filters for all posts with the according tag, and outputs them sorted by the date, backwards. 

I realise more and more that prompt enegeering comined with the ability to upload/transfer the data might be the next great thing.
