For the first time ever, my ratio between building and consuming hit 1:1.

It sounds simple, but it’s not. It means every hour I spend watching videos, scrolling, reading random things, or letting myself drift… I match with an hour spent learning something real or building something tangible.

Outside of school.

This wasn’t a goal I planned. It just happened because I suddenly saw how much time slips away unnoticed when you’re not paying attention. So I started tracking it — not perfectly, but honestly. And the numbers surprised me. When the day felt “busy,” half of that busyness was just passive input.

Fixing that didn’t require any big system. Just intention.

Some days the building part is learning a new tool, some days it’s writing, programming, automating something small, working on my website, exploring 3D printing, or thinking through a project. The actual output varies, but the logic stays the same: create at least as much as I consume.

The weird part: the more I build, the better I feel. The more I consume, the emptier it feels.

Hitting 1:1 isn’t the end goal. It’s just the first stabilised baseline — the point where I can’t lie to myself anymore about how my time disappears. From here I want to push the ratio further. 2:1. Maybe 3:1. Not because it’s a challenge, but because building creates momentum, and consumption kills it.

Right now I’m not perfect. Far from it. But for the first time I can actually see the balance. And I’m starting to understand what my days look like when I’m the one designing them.
