I’ve had so much to do with school over the past seven days — about two exams a day — which was pretty stressful. Still, I managed to find some time in my packed schedule to finish coding and writing this post. Hopefully, I’ll have more time during the holidays next week.

### From the Roots

I structured this website into two main pages: this one, called Home, and the Builds page. This is where I’ll upload posts like this one to share my story.
Then there are two other pages — About Me and Philosophy — which serve to share information that doesn’t change very often. They’re more of a set-and-forget type of thing, though I’ll update them from time to time.

### Behind the Scenes

To fill the two main pages with content, I chose to have a folder where I simply upload all my posts. I label them with either Home or Builds tags to keep them sorted and to automatically publish them on the correct page.
I had no idea how this sorting algorithm could work, so I asked ChatGPT — and it generated the perfect code literally after the first prompt! I was quite surprised by how well it worked.
The code just filters all posts with the corresponding tag and sorts them by date in reverse order.

I’m starting to realize more and more that prompt engineering combined with the ability to upload and transfer data might be the next big thing.
