I finally added a “Builds” section to my website — this is where the most exciting stuff will happen!

Just getting this page online was the first challenge, but I think the even harder part will be figuring out how to fill it with posts automatically. I’ll probably publish a report on the homepage once the full structure is finished.

I’m going to upload detailed posts about my projects here — what I built and what I learned along the way.

Hopefully, this section will fill up soon! The coming week of school is going to be pretty stressful, I see where I can find the time.
